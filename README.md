# Airbnb Price Prediction

This repository is the work for my first project from the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program where I analyzed the dataset from Airbnb and provide some interesting insights about Boston Airbnb listings' activities.

### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

The code is saved in `.ipynb` file and can be run with any tool that support this file format.
These are libraries that is used in this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- geopandas

I run this directly on Google Colab so in case you want to run on this platform, just run the code from beginning to the end. For datasets, download them from Airbnb and put them in Google Drive.
### Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This project aims to answer these questions:

1. How is the price distributed in different areas? 
2. How are rooms occupied and their distribution over a year?
3. How are rooms occupied by season and distributed on the map?

### Results <a name="results"></a>

For the code, please check the notebook `boston_airbnb_analysis.ipynb`.

The findings of this project has been published [here](https://medium.com/@d.huy723/clustering-helps-to-improve-price-prediction-in-online-booking-systems-3aab0e2dc83b).

### Acknowledgements <a name="acknowledgements"></a>

This project use data from [InsideAirbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/) (London 2019). To download the dataset used in this project, check this drive [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XwK4Z6vm7OFdrAWySAcbIv8Me0YEB6Gc?usp=sharing).

The code is inspired by Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.
